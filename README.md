## Summary

The website serves as a digital archive for the texts, images, and news generated from the Nheenga Cabana project, bringing together reference materials about the Cabanagem Revolt, a popular uprising that took place in the Northern region of Brazil in the 19th century.

## Description

cabanagem200 is a website that permanently showcases files from the collection of works Nheenga Cabana, created in 2022 by artists Giseli Vasconcelos and Pedro Victor Brandão. The project was commissioned by MAM-Rio and was part of the exhibition 'Acts of Revolt: alternative imaginaries on independence.' The website functions as a digital archive for the texts, images, and news generated within the scope of the project.

The Cabanagem Revolution was a popular uprising that took place in the 19th century during the monarchy period in Brazil. It was one of the major popular revolts in Brazilian history, yet it remains poorly documented in historiography. Artists Giseli Vasconcelos and Pedro Victor Brandão took advantage of the bicentennial of Brazil's independence to focus on the Cabanagem as the subject of their conceptual art project, Nheenga Cabana. The project was presented in the exhibition 'Acts of Revolt: alternative imaginaries on independence' at MAM-Rio, curated by Beatriz Lemos, Keyna Eleison, Pablo Lafuente, and Thiago de Paula Souza.

The website serves as a permanent archive for the collection of materials specifically created for the exhibition. These materials include: a special edition of Jornal Pessoal featuring texts by researcher Lúcio Flávio Pinto; images generated through artificial intelligence, based on the texts by Lúcio Flávio Pinto; images resulting from the artists' research process with Machine Learning technologies; the textual inputs that generated those images; and news articles published by national and international media outlets about the project.

Most of the extensive collection of materials can be accessed on the homepage of the website, which is divided into several sections. This type of presentation guides the visitor through an overview of this vast material. Users also have access to a PDF version of the publication related to the project, which can be downloaded or read directly in the browser. The images generated by artificial intelligence can be viewed in detail through lightboxes, allowing users to zoom in on the images.

For the design, simplicity and minimalism were chosen to allow the content to stand out over the presentation. Subtle animations were added, and each formal decision was made based on prior discussions with the project authors.

## Technical Specifications

The project was written in the React 18 syntax, utilizing the pages routing structure of Next.js 13.

Tailwind CSS was used for the complete styling of each component on the website, which were custom-built for the site.

The website is fully responsive, providing an excellent user experience for desktop, mobile, or tablet users. All pages have both dark mode and light mode versions, which can be activated through a button in the navigation bar.
